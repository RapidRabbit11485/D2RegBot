# D2RegBot
Destiny 2 Clan Registration Discord Bot

This is a bot for Discord that will allow Clan Admins to admit or reject pending applicants via the Bungie API. It uses ASP.NET Boilerplate, DSharp, and JSON.NET. The bot will PM a clan admin when a new applicant is found. The clan admin then can accept or reject the user via the Bungie API by reacting with an emoji.
